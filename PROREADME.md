    ## Installation
    What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

    ## Usage
    Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

    ## License
    The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

    ## Badges
    Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

    ## How to Contribute
    If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

    ## Tests
    Go the extra mile and write tests for your application.
