# Professional README.MD Generator

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## User Story
As a developer, I want a README generator, so I can quickly create a professional README.md file for any new project.

## Description
* This is a command-line application, which will prompt users for infomation about their repository. At the end of all the questions a professional README.md is generated with the title of the project, description, table of contents, installation steps, usage, license, how to contribute, tests and questions.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [Questions](#questions)
- [License](#license)

## Installation
* In the root directory you want to run "npm i" to initalize npm.

## Usage
* User can type "npm start" or "node index.js" to start the user prompt in the root directory. Upon finishing all the questions, a markdown file will be generated called PROREADME.md
* Feel free to change the prompt questions add or minus from the index.js file.
* The README.md content can also be changed in the generateMarkdown.js file.
* This project uses the npm inquirer package.
